## 👋 Hello, I'm chaerheeon (이채언) / lillian.rhee

I'm an AI developer who loves building and experimenting with new technologies — especially around machine learning, data science, and LLMs.
I specialize in building AI, LLM services, and efficient backend systems — often with Python, FastAPI, and a lot of debugging.  
Let’s make something useful (and maybe weird) together. 🚀

## 💡 My Values

1️⃣ **Save Instinct** 💾 – If you don’t save it, it’s gone. Git and Ctrl+S are survival tools.  
2️⃣ **Debugging Master** 🔍 – Bugs aren’t enemies to avoid, they’re beasts to hunt. Logic and grit are my weapons of choice.  
3️⃣ **Caffeine Buff** ☕ – Coffee, green tea, anything to fuel my brain before the code crashes.



## 🧠 How I Work

I always start by setting clear goals, then break them down into manageable steps.  
When there's a new technology or framework, I enjoy testing it hands-on and figuring out the best way to apply it.  
I make a habit of documenting what I learn — every mistake is a lesson for the future.  
While I usually prefer working from home, I occasionally enjoy the café coding life too.
